  Hi! This is will be my official first entry as it's the game that is freshest in my mind.
  Thus, I come to you with my thoughts on <strong>Control</strong>, Remedy's most recent addition to their line of spectacular works.
  If you don't know Remedy; they are responsible for Max Payne <small>2001</small> Alan Wake <small>2010</small>, and Quantum Break <small>2016</small>.
  Control was my first foray into Remedy's titles, with the exception of Max Payne which I vaguely remember experiencing
  by excitingly looking over my older brother's shoulder while he hogged the controller and called me names: good times.<br>

  <br>Regardless, I consider this my first official bout with Remedy, and I've got to say it was a beauty.
  The game centers around the protagonist "Jesse Faden's"<i>(mo-cap and voice by Courtney Hope)</i> appointment of Director to the very secretive,
  and very impossible Federal Bureau of Control housed in a giant high rise somewhere in New York which is appropriate considering
  New Yorkers have a knack for minding their own business.<br>

  <br>Upon arrival we find the bureau has been attacked by some otherworldly being dubbed the Hiss, and from there the game takes you on a ride
  filled with great story-telling and meticulous world building. Admittingly, the first few minutes of the game consisted of me wandering and
  finding my bearings because I had no idea what the hell was going on. I felt lost. In retrospect, it's great conveyance.<br>

  <br>That being said, once I began the first few missions things started to get interesting. Remedy did a great job in creating a world inside a
  building filled with bureaucrats that I actually felt interested in. Mainly because all the pencil pushers were suspended in the air which added to the
  already eerie tone of the setting, but also because the mere thought of having a desk job with an extra dimensional portal down the hall is absolutely insane,
  where do I sign up?<br>

  <br>The scenery is beautiful, the story is compelling, and the gameplay feels fluid. It's a third person shooter so you'll have to shoot your way through enemies,
  that get progressively annoying, using a gun called the <strong>Service Weapon</strong>. This thing can be upgraded and can change modes but you can only have two modes
  equipped at a time, which in my opinion diminishes the weapon as I tend to forget to change my mode while I'm busy playing. However, it might work for some so, if you're a fan of "pew pews" then you're set.
  In addition to the weapon, you'll find yourself acquiring new sets of skills that are upgradeable via skill tree. From there, players can develop their own style of gameplay
  by using any combination of abilities that feels comfortable to them. A few of these skills include, <strong>LAUNCH</strong> and <strong>SEIZE</strong> granting you
  the power to chuck stuff at people doing exceptional damage, and taking control of one of your enemies for a limited amount of time
  in case you get lonely and need a friend. I mention these two specifically because I used them the most in the game, as well as in real life.<br>

  <br><img src = "../images/games/control2.png"><br>

   <br>Lastly, I'd like to go a little more in-depth on the world building that goes on here. If you've played any of the previous
   Remedy titles you'll know about their love of storytelling often through means of collectables that players can find
   throughout the game to supplement the narrative. This is no different for Control.
   In addition to collectables, Remedy has included references and mentions of their previous titles, as I understand they've done
   in the past, and created a shared universe; slowly building up to something big and culminating into something bigger<i>(I hope.)</i>
   Should you decide to play the game, keep a lookout for references to Alan Wake and perhaps Quantum Break, and share them with me.
   I’ve probably only scratched the surface and would love to know more!<br>

   <br>I've only just completed the game, and I am currently experiencing post-game depression.
   You know that feeling you get when you finish a tv show you were really invested in and you feel like you've lost someone close to your
   because you'll probably never see them again. That. I have it.
   I didn't realize I was hooked until it was over. The game is great. Plain and simple. Does it have flaws? Duh.
   Like, perhaps the map is hard to read and sometimes barely makes sense, or like the fact that falling was the most
   dangerous aspect of <strong>The Former</strong>! That was annoying; audibly yelled. I suffered more from cooldowns than I did the actual enemies,
   which says more about me than anything else. You can breeze through the game and enjoy a nice story; it is what Remedy’s all about.
   They’ve put an obscene amount of effort in the narrative they’re attempting to relay, and it shows.<br>

   <br>Remedy has created a world with odd science and physics, creepy foes, great visuals, and tie-ins to previous titles. It’s a game worth playing, don’t let anybody tell you different.

   <br><br><strong>TAKE CONTROL</strong>!<br><br>

   <br>The game is set for two expansions so far, <strong>The Foundation</strong> and <strong>AWE</strong> the former having already been released early for PS4 and Windows,
   with a later release for XBOX and the other is set for Summer 2020. I'll add an updated review upon my playing them. Until then, stay tuned!<br>

   <br>I picked up the game during a sale for $29.99, and I do not regret the decision, however, it is currently available on XBOX GAMEPASS<br>

   <br>I give it 4.5 Bolts out of 5 due to visuals, sound, and overal enjoyment!

   <br>Thanks for reading!<br>
