        <br>Please join me in a ceremonial smashing of a bottle on this
        proverbial ship that is Nuts & Bolts. Ok, I won’t actually
        smash a bottle because, well, danger, but all the same!<br>

        <br>Welcome to <strong>Nuts & Bolts</strong> Ivotron’s official blog for anything
        I find interesting regarding movies, games, comics, etc. I
        created this initially as a newsletter back when I was actively
        photographing Cosplay, and attempting to expand Ivotron as a business.
        Overtime, that aspiration dwindled and I was left with a foundation
        of something I didn't want to die. Thus, I decided to make Ivotron into
        my personal nerdy persona. It’s my way of organizing my life by
        dividing up my interests, whilst also filling me with a sense of purpose.
        I spent many years, countless hours, and several coffees teaching
        myself how to code so that I could create something from scratch;
        finally that has come to fruition and I’m happy to share it with anyone
        who has the time.<br>

        <br><img src = "../images/cosplayBanner.jpg"><br>

        <br>I currently don't have a plan regarding content but I hope to figure
        it out as I go, and just write about whatever I feel like. Although,
        I do wish to contribute something of use to readers, I’m going to
        try and not let that completely dictate what I output. To some extent,
        I may just use this as a diary of sorts, a place to jot down my thoughts
        about the subjects mentioned above.<br>

        <br>So, now I'll go play many games, watch many anime, and many comics/books
        so that I may write about it later. I do hope you enjoy any amount of
        time you spend here. Please do not hesitate to inquire, comment, or
        reach out to me for any reason. I'll try to respond as best I can!<br>

        Thank you all for reading.<br>

        <br>See you, internet people.<br>
